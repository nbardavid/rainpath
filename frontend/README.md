## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+, `pnpm`
- Backend API running at `http://localhost:5433` (or set `VITE_API_URL`)

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown by Vite). Use `pnpm run build` to create a production build and `pnpm run serve` to preview it locally.
